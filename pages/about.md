Hey there! 

I'm Jo√£o, welcome to my personal page.

I alternate between research and building products.

**Products**

- [Alpaca Law](https://alpacalaw.com) is a conversational AI specialised in Portugal laws and case laws.
- [Optimal Agriculture](https://optimal.ag) is on a mission to grow safer, healthier food by deploying fully autonomous indoor farms outside every city on earth.
- [Polys.art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lym9_bg67Q) is an art collection that resulted from the search of the highest beauty with the fewest bits. Some pieces were done using AI and others were done manually by selected artists.
- [Gymnast Training](https://gymnast.training) has simplified a science-based training program to gain strength without using weights.
- [AI Coach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6klNzmR-vk) was using human pose estimation to analyse athletes technique.
- many many more than are not worth mentioning..

**Research**

- I am interested in complex adaptable systems like evolution, economics and sociology.
- Especially proud of this paper: [Mimicking Evolution with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00048).
- Was a Research Resident in [Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai) in 2024/2025.

**Education**

- Started a PhD in Robotics and ML @EPFL (dropped out to build Optimal Agriculture)
- MSc in Biomedical engineering @IST
- BSc in Physics @IST


I am into personal growth, meaningful relationships, health and sports. Very proud of having represented Portugal at pole-vaulting in the European Youth Olympics, Belgrade 2007 :) !
